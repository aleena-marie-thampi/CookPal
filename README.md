# 🍳 CookPal

## 🔍 Overview

Most people waste time searching for recipes or end up cooking the same few dishes because they can’t easily find recipes that match what’s in their kitchen.  
**CookPal** solves this by letting you enter your available ingredients and instantly fetch recipe ideas — complete with cooking steps, prep time, and tips.
